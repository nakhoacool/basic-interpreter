# **Basic Interpreter in Go**

This project is a basic interpreter implemented in Go, inspired by the book [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. The primary purpose of this project is to enhance my understanding of both the Go programming language and the fundamentals of interpreter design.

## **Project Overview**

This interpreter is designed to parse and execute a simple programming language, which includes features like:

- **Lexical Analysis:** Breaking down the input text into tokens.
- **Parsing:** Analyzing the token stream to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Evaluation:** Executing the AST to produce results.

## **Features**

- **Lexer:** Converts input strings into tokens.
- **Parser:** Generates an AST from tokens.
- **Interpreter:** Executes expressions and statements defined in the language.
- **Error Handling:** Includes basic mechanisms to handle syntax and runtime errors.

## **Why This Project?**

I embarked on this project to:
- **Learn Go:** Gain hands-on experience with Go's syntax and standard library.
- **Understand Interpreters:** Grasp the core concepts of language interpretation, such as lexing, parsing, and evaluation.
- **Build a Foundation:** Prepare for more advanced topics in language design and compiler construction.

## **Acknowledgments**

This project is heavily based on concepts from the book [*Writing an Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball. I highly recommend this resource to anyone interested in understanding interpreters and programming languages.
